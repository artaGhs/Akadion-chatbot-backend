Phase 1: Foundational Architecture & Setup
A senior engineer begins by establishing a robust foundation to prevent future refactoring and ensure the project is scalable from day one.

Project Scaffolding and Dependency Management:

Virtual Environment: The first step is always to create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.   

Dependency Management: All necessary packages (fastapi, uvicorn[standard], python-dotenv, google-generativeai, langchain, chromadb, pypdf, etc.) will be listed in a requirements.txt file for reproducible environments.   

Directory Structure: A layered architecture is non-negotiable for maintainability. The project will be organized by function, not just by feature.

|--.env                  # Environment variables (API keys, etc.)
|-- requirements.txt      # Project dependencies
|-- src/
| |-- init.py
| |-- main.py           # FastAPI app instance, middleware, top-level routers
| |-- api/              # API layer: Routers and endpoint definitions

| |-- models/           # Data layer: Pydantic models for validation
| | |-- init.py
| | |-- schemas.py
| |-- core/             # Core components: Config, DB connections
| | |-- init.py
| | |-- config.py
|-- tests/                # Test suite
```

Configuration Management:

Sensitive information like the Gemini API key and database connection strings will be stored exclusively in a .env file.   

A config.py file will use Pydantic's BaseSettings to load, validate, and provide type-hinted access to these environment variables throughout the application. This centralizes configuration and prevents hardcoding.

Asynchronous-First Design:

The entire application will be designed to be asynchronous. FastAPI's primary strength is its performance with I/O-bound operations. Since a RAG pipeline involves multiple network calls (to the vector DB and the Gemini API), every function that performs I/O will be defined with    

async def to ensure the server remains non-blocking and can handle high concurrency.

Phase 2: Core Service Implementation
With the architecture in place, the focus shifts to building the core logic within the services layer.

Ingestion Service (ingestion_service.py):

This service will contain the logic for processing uploaded knowledge base files.   

File Handling: It will accept an UploadFile object from the API layer. For large files, it will stream the file to disk to avoid high memory usage.

Text Extraction: It will use a robust library like PyMuPDF (Fitz) for its superior performance and ability to handle complex PDF layouts. It will also handle plain text files.   

Chunking: It will employ the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain, as it provides a good balance of semantic coherence and efficiency by attempting to split on paragraphs and sentences first.   

Vectorization & Storage: The text chunks will be passed to the Gemini embedding model (genai.embed_content) using the crucial task_type='RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT' parameter for optimal retrieval performance. The resulting embeddings, along with the original text chunks and unique IDs, will be stored in the vector database.   

RAG Service (rag_service.py):

This service orchestrates the entire retrieval-augmentation-generation process.   

Query Embedding: It will take the user's question and generate an embedding, this time using task_type='RETRIEVAL_QUERY' to create an embedding optimized for search.   

Context Retrieval: It will use the query embedding to perform a similarity search against the vector database (initially ChromaDB) and retrieve the top k most relevant text chunks.   

Prompt Engineering: A ChatPromptTemplate from LangChain will be used to construct a precise and structured prompt. This template will clearly separate the system instructions, the retrieved context, and the user's question to guide the LLM effectively.   

LLM Generation: The augmented prompt will be sent to the Gemini generative model. For the best user experience, this will be a streaming call.

Phase 3: API Layer and Full-Stack Integration
This phase exposes the business logic through secure and efficient API endpoints.

API Endpoints (api/ directory):

/ingest (POST): This endpoint will handle file uploads. It will use FastAPI's UploadFile for efficient file handling. To prevent the API from hanging on large file uploads, this endpoint can be designed to trigger the ingestion process as a background task.   

/chat (POST): This is the primary user-facing endpoint. It will accept a user's query and stream the response back in real-time.

Streaming Implementation: The endpoint will return a StreamingResponse. The core logic will be an async generator function that orchestrates the RAG service call. As the Gemini API yields tokens for the final answer, the generator will immediately yield those tokens to the client, providing an interactive, real-time experience.   

/health (GET): A simple endpoint returning a 200 OK status, essential for production monitoring and load balancers.

Data Validation (models/schemas.py):

Pydantic models will be used to define the expected structure of all API request and response bodies. This provides automatic data validation, conversion, and generates a precise OpenAPI schema for documentation.   

CORS Configuration (main.py):

CORSMiddleware will be configured to allow requests from the Next.js frontend's origin (e.g., http://localhost:3000 for development), ensuring seamless communication between the decoupled frontend and backend.   

Phase 4: Testing and Production Readiness
A senior engineer builds for reliability.

Testing Strategy:

A comprehensive test suite will be developed using pytest and FastAPI's TestClient.   

Unit Tests: Will cover individual functions within the service layer, mocking external dependencies like the Gemini API and vector DB.

Integration Tests: Will test the full request-response flow of the API endpoints, ensuring routers, services, and models work together correctly.

Containerization and Deployment:

The application will be containerized using Docker to create a consistent and portable environment.   

A deployment strategy will be planned, targeting a serverless platform like Vercel for ease of use and scalability, or a more traditional cloud provider for greater control. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines will be set up to automate testing and deployment on every push to the main branch.
